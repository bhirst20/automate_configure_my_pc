# system_automation

What follows in this repo are some automated scripts to help me when I configure new systems either when I get them or re-install the OS. I have avoided composite collections as every PC I rebuild tends to have different needs and demands. Feel free to copy anything you see, it's not under any license. But in general, this is just an easy way for me to do things. All comments welcome!

## Structure

- `nix/` - Bash scripts for Linux and macOS
- `windows/` - PowerShell scripts using winget

# Usage

Checkout with the below command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bhirst20/automate_configure_my_pc.git
```
